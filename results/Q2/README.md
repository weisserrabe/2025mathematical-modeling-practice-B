## Economic Interpretation

### Risk-On vs Risk-Off Dynamics
The correlation patterns reveal gold's role in different market conditions:

**Risk-Off Assets (Positive Correlation):**
- Precious metals (Silver, Platinum) show strong positive correlations
- These assets tend to rise together during uncertainty

**Risk-On Assets (Negative Correlation):**  
- Stock indices (S&P 500, Dow Jones) show negative correlations
- When markets are optimistic, gold demand typically decreases

**Currency Effects:**
- USD Index typically shows strong negative correlation
- EUR/USD movements affect gold's attractiveness to different currencies

### Investment Implications

🔍 **Portfolio Diversification:** Factors with low/negative correlations provide diversification benefits

📈 **Trend Following:** High positive correlations indicate potential momentum strategies

⚖️ **Hedging Strategies:** Strong negative correlations suggest effective hedging pairs
